This repo is used to build QEMU specific device trees for the HPSC Chiplet
architecture. These device trees are used by the HPSC project's QEMU to
internally generate machine models.

To build the device trees:
   1. You must have dtc on your PATH, or specify DTC= env to a dtc executable.
   2. Run make

This will give you a folder called LATEST which contains subdirectories for the
different QEMU operating modes. Under these sub directories is the board
specific device trees.
